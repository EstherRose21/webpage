# Overview
Women in the United States earn about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, as illustrated by the graph below. Mind-boggling, right? This gender pay gap refers to the median annual income of all women, compared to median annual income of all men ^["The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap." American Association of University Women, www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/.]. Occupational segregation, motherhood and unconscious biases have fostered these disparities. 

The graph below reveals that women on average earn about 10,000 dollars less than men, which is about 6,000 dollars less than the national average. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#This graph is showing the average salary by gender 
ggplot(Nationally, aes(x = type, y = Salary, fill = Gender)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  geom_text(aes(label=dollar(Salary)), vjust=1.6, color="white", size=3.5)+
  labs(title = "Average Salary Disparity by Gender in the US", x = "", y = "Yearly Salary") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=dollar)+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("National Average" = "purple","Women"= "pink" ,"Men" = "blue"))+
  theme(legend.position = 'none')+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
```

## Problem Set
To what extent and under what conditions does the gender pay gap persist? How can it be ameliorated? While the gender pay gap has improved from the 1960‚Äôs when a woman earned 60 cents for every dollar that a man earned, the gender pay gap still persists today ^["Why does the gender wage gap still exist?" CNN, www.cnn.com/videos/cnnmoney/2018/04/10/why-does-teh-wage-gap-still-exist.cnn/video/playlists/womens-issues-worldwide/.]

## Description of Data
To explore this issue, we wrangled and visualized two data sets from kaggle titled ‚ÄúU.S. Incomes by Occupation and Gender‚Äù, which was retrieved from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and ‚ÄúUS Census Demographic Data, which was retrieved from the American Community Survey (ACS). Additionally, we derived data of average salaries by gender in all 50 states from the American Association of University Women‚Äôs website. This data was provided in PDF format, so my partner and I manually transformed this data set into an excel spreadsheet for data wrangling. 

## Why is this important? 
If women were paid the same as men, women would gain billions of dollars in earnings every year ^["The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap." American Association of University Women, www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/.]. This would raise their economic status, fostering greater gender equality. Furthermore, women would be able to improve their living conditions if they become divorced or widowed ^["The gender pay gap." The Economist, 7 Oct. 2017, www.economist.com/international/2017/10/07/the-gender-pay-gap.].
